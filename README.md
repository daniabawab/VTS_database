## Introduction: 

In today's era of sustainability and conscious consumption, thrift stores play a pivotal role in providing affordable and environmentally friendly shopping options. Today, in the United States, there are more than 28,000 thrift stores. However, managing the diverse inventory and streamlining operations within thrift stores can be challenging without a robust database management system (DBMS). Our thrift store DBMS aims to address these challenges by providing a centralized platform for efficient inventory management, sales processing, and customer relationship management.
